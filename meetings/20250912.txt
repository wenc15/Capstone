2025.9.12 Meeting with instructor
Attendees: All 6 member
Checking the possible risks and feasibility of the 3 topics.

- Focus App:
Using other devices might bypass the app’s detection.
- Mental Health Platform:
With AI: Accuracy is questionable; AI errors could lead to serious consequences. Perhaps users should seek advice from mental health professionals instead?
Without AI: Purpose is unclear—would it just be an ordinary scheduling app?
- Discord Bot:
Is the importance of Discord being overestimated?
